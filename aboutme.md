# About Brenna 
Growing up on Whidbey Island, WA, I've been enamored with marine ecosystems for as long as I can remember. Because of this, I chose to pursue a B.S. in Biology from Oregon State University. After graduating in 2022, I worked for the Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO), led by the Lubchenco-Menge Lab at Oregon State.

In my spare time, I enjoy tide pooling, pressing seaweed, hiking, cooking, playing guitar, attending concerts, and spending time with my friends and family.

Prior to attending UW, I was a Faculty Research Assistant with the [Lubchenco-Menge Lab at Oregon State University](https://www.lubchencomengelab.com/). Under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Menge and Dr. Sarah Gravem, I led a mussel mortality project investigating an unusual die-off of *Mytilus californianus* on the Oregon coast. I also helped manage the field operations as a branch of [The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)](https://piscoweb.org/). Before this, I was a seasonal research assistant for the lab and PISCO, conducting rocky intertidal fieldwork in Oregon and California. 

### Undergraduate Research
As part of my academic journey at Oregon State, I was an undergraduate research fellow studying the reproductive timing of the critically endangered sunflower sea star, *Pycnopodia helianthoides*. I also spent a term living out at the Hatfield Marine Science Center as part of OSU's upper divison marine biology and ecology course.

Prior to attending UW, I was a Faculty Research Assistant with the [Lubchenco-Menge Lab at Oregon State University](https://www.lubchencomengelab.com/). Under the guidance of Dr. Bruce Menge and Dr. Sarah Gravem, I led a mussel mortality project investigating an unusual die-off of *Mytilus californianus* on the Oregon coast. I also helped manage the field operations as a branch of [The Partnership for Interdisciplinary Studies of Coastal Oceans (PISCO)](https://piscoweb.org/). Before this, I was a seasonal research assistant for the lab and PISCO, conducting rocky intertidal fieldwork in Oregon and California.

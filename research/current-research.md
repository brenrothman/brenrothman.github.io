### Undergraduate Research
As part of my academic journey at Oregon State, I was an undergraduate research fellow studying the reproductive timing of the critically endangered sunflower sea star, *Pycnopodia helianthoides*. I also spent a term living out at the Hatfield Marine Science Center as part of OSU's upper divison marine biology and ecology course.

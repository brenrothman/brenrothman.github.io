# Social Media 
As a way to share my journey as a scientist and explorer, I use Instagram to create posts highlighting the importance and brilliance of marine ecosystems. Follow along on Instagram [@barnacle_brenna](https://www.instagram.com/barnacle.brenna/?locale=de_DE&hl=ko) to learn more. 

Before creating my own account, I managed the lab Instagram for the [Menge Lab at OSU](https://www.instagram.com/mengelab_osu/) until spring 2024.   

# Undergraduate Mentorship
I wouldn't be where I am today without a little help along the way. That being said, I am particularly passionate about mentoring young scientists. 
I've had the privilege of mentoring three undergraduate students at Oregon State with their very own research projects as part of the URSA and SURE programs at OSU. If you are an undergraduate student at the University of Washington interested in GIS and marine systems, contact me at brenroth@uw.edu for research opportunities. 

# Invited Presentations
The Cape Perpetua Collaborative, an environmental stewardship organization, invited me to host a webinar where I discussed the vital science being conducted on the Oregon Coast by mt former research group. Link to my webinar [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LEeD-TBeGvk)

I'm a first-year graduate student in the Marine Landscape Ecology Lab at the University of Washington - School of Aquatic and Fishery Sciences. 
My focal research is about evaluating the role of habitat complexity in rocky intertidal disturbance regimes. My intent is to use a combination of fieldwork, aerial imaging, GIS, and modeling to disentangle the relationships between habitat complexity, disturbance, and biodiversity in a dynamic marine landscape.
